\section{Original Problem}
A beam of vertically polarized light is passed through a series of polarizers.
The first polarizer is vertically aligned, and a second polarizer is at a 
$45^\circ$ degree ($\pi/4$ radian) angle from vertical. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the relative intensity of the light beam after passing through
        the two polarizers? 
    \item If a third polarizer is inserted in between the two, at what angle 
        should it be oriented to maximize the total light intensity? 
\end{enumerate}

The probability of a single photon with a vertical polarization passing through
a polarizer at an angle $\Phi$ from vertical is given by 
\begin{equation}
P = \cos^2(\Phi)
\end{equation}
When $\Phi=0$, the transmission probability is $100\%$, and when $\Phi=\pi/2$ the
probability is 0\%.
